## Potential bug in DAISIE

There may be a bug in DAISIE. 

We used a bleeding-edge and untested version of DAISIE.

[Issue 190](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/pbdmms/issues/190) signalled the problem

[Issue 221](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/pbdmms/issues/211) failed to replicate the problem,
as there were higher priorities than write a bug report.

It is unknown what the consequences of this bug are. It is expected these are small, as it happened
after parameter estimation. It can also be hoped for that the next CRAN version will have it fixed.
